# SampaguitaOS
SampaguitaOS is a hobby 32-bit operating system kernel, written primarily in C and Assembly, targeting the x86 architecture. The project is focused on learning the fundamentals of bare-metal development, boot protocols (Multiboot 1), kernel architecture, and device driver implementation.

SampaguitaOS is under active development and is intended solely for recreational programming and learning.
